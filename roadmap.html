  <h1>CyberVerse</h1>
  <p>
 Given the advent of the metaverse and the web3 hysteria, we've decided to take up a niche in this young industry. We're building a high tech society in the metaverse with a dystopian theme.
This project is targeted at writers, graphic designers, gamers and cyberpunkers. These individuals will contribute to building our dystopian society in the metaverse. That's the whole point of a decentralised ecosystem, and that's what we're doing.
Weekly writing contest would be held and the best story would be included in our narrative which would also be posted on our twitter wall. Of course the writer gets rewarded with CBV tokens. Graphic designers would also get to submit their art every month for a chance to also win more CBV tokens. Holders would aslo get to stake for rewards and buy NFTs created by our community.

Build with us, contribute, creativity through Crypto.</p>
  <h1>CyberVerse Present And The Future</h1>
  <p>Early birds holding a minimum of $100 worth of CBV tokens would be whitelisted for our nft collection. But for now, we'll be hosting a competition where individuals will submit short stories and scripts for weekly phublishing on our twitter wall. The story with the most traffic would be rewarded. <br>
  Build with us. Follow us on twitter and stay updated.</p>
